            <h2>Project: Automated Sewerage Monitoring System</h2>
            <p>
                As part of my recent project, I worked on developing an automated sewerage monitoring system aimed at improving water management and preventing blockages in sewerage systems. This project involved designing sensors for real-time monitoring, data analysis for predictive maintenance, and creating a user-friendly interface for the systemâ€™s operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge in design and heat transfer, as I had to account for environmental factors and ensure the system's efficiency.
